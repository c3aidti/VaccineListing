# Vaccine Listing Example

The C3 Covid-19 Datalake contains data about ongoing clinical trails related to covid 19. This notebook explores how to fetch this data, transform it into a usable form, and some simple data analysis.

## Python Implementation

The python implementation of this example is located in the `python` directory. This example can be run with any python environment containing a jupyter notebook installation and requests and pandas libraries.

We provide a conda environment definition file `env.yaml` which should work as well. To provision an appropriate conda environment run `conda env create -f env.yaml -p <path_to_prefix>` or `conda env -f env.yaml -n <name_of_environment`.

Once an appropriate environment is set up, launch the jupyter notebook, and execute the cells within.
